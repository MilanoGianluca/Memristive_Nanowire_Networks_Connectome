# Memristive_Nanowire_Networks_Connectome


This repository contains codes of the paper "Connectome of memristive nanowire networks through graph theory" by Gianluca Milano, Enrique Miranda and Carlo Ricciardi
Neural Networks, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2022.02.022

The python scripts in the folder allow to perform analysis of the structural and functional connectivity of the memristive NW network connectome through graph theory. 

The module "wires" used to create the network structure was imported and adapted from the model reported in the work by Loeffler, Alon, et al.,"Topological properties of neuromorphic nanowire networks", Frontiers in Neuroscience 14 (2020): 184. https://github.com/aloe8475/CODE/blob/master/Analysis/Generate%20Networks/wires.py
